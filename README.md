# 60 Years of Pop Music on Spotify: Exploring the Fluctuation of Audio Features

## Abstract

In music, pop is a broad term used to describe songs that are popular in the mainstream. 
This study aims to identify what characteristics make pop music appealing to a wide audience 
and how those characteristics have changed over time. To get an insight into what audio 
features characterize songs in the pop genre, linear regression analyses and time series 
exploration will be performed on annotated Spotify data. For any song, Spotify provides 
metadata including information about scores for the features danceability, energy, 
instrumentalness, loudness, tempo and valence. The analysis did not show convincing linear 
relationships and decomposing the variables' time series into trend and seasonality did not 
reveal patterns in the data.

## Project organization
The repository both contains the data and the analysis aplied in the study, and a folder 
containing the files used for scraping the data.
